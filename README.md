Contact switches, bumpers, optical barriers, noncontact proximity sensor

Wheel/motion:  wheel/motor speed and position
Brush encoders, potentiometers, synchros, resolvers, optical encoders, magnetic encoders, inductive encoders, capacitive encoders

Heading: orientation of robot in relation to a fixed reference frame
Compass, gyroscope, inclinometers, 

Ground-based: localization in a fixed reference frame
